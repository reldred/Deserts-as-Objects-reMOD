## reMOD?

Hahahahahah i'm back again to ruin another grf. This fork adds the ability to replace the desert baseset tiles with OpenGFX2 arctic tiles, and also adds support for JGRPP desert rocks. Needs JGR's NMLC to compile. I didn't touch objects, they looked scary, and I don't use them.

## About

The main goal of this NewGRF is to provide a **desert landscape**, regardless of your map's climate.<br>
It utilizes desert tiles from OpenGFX and OpenGFX2 **as objects**; both versions also come in variants _with_ and _without_ gridlines, resulting in four possible combinations of tiles.<br>
The ground tiles are complemented by objects such as rocks, greenery, people, cars, and oases.

![Objects.](_readme/objects.png)

For games using the _Sub-tropical_ climate, there is an option to **replace** the base set's **desert terrain tiles** with other variants. This allows, for example, an OpenGFX2 gridless desert alongside an otherwise OpenGFX-styled landscape (see [Features](#image-anchor) below).<br>
Additionally, you can enable the game to generate a desired number of **oases** and **rocks**, adding some sparkle to your deserts.


## Features

- Offers **replacement** of your current baseset's deserts (_with_ or _without_ gridlines).<a name="image-anchor"></a>

![Desert replacement.](_readme/replacement.png)

- Adds **desert terrain tiles as objects** from OpenGFX and OpenGFX2 (_with_ or _without_ gridlines).<br>
All ground tiles are **slope-aware** and **coast-aware** - you can just drag them across the terrain, and they will automatically adjust.

- When playing in the Sub-arctic climate, **snowline-responsive** options for sand and rock tiles become available.<br>
Versions with permanent snow are included in all climates.

- All greenery + people with cars feature **32 variations per slope**, minimizing visible repetition when placed in large numbers.
- Oases can only be placed on flat terrain, but offer **512 layout variations** to ensure visual diversity.
- Supports **automatic spawning of objects** such as oases and rocks in various colors during map generation (see [Random object spawning](#random-object-spawning) for details).


## Parameters

The following parameters allow customization of the NewGRF's features:

![Parameters.](_readme/parameters.png)


### Desert graphics replacement

Select the **desert style** to replace your base set's desert tiles:

- None _(no replacement)_
- OpenGFX2 (gridlines)
- OpenGFX2 (no gridlines)
- OpenGFX (gridlines)
- OpenGFX (no gridlines)


### Add desert tiles as objects

Choose which combinations of _base set_ and _gridlines_ will be available as **placeable objects**:

- OpenGFX desert tiles (gridlines)
- OpenGFX desert tiles (no gridlines)
- OpenGFX2 desert tiles (gridlines)
- OpenGFX2 desert tiles (no gridlines)


### Random object spawning

Controls **random object placement** during map generation.<br>
The number represents _the amount of objects placed on a 256×256 tile map_ (for reference, there would be 15 transmitters on such a map).

The objects have a 4×4 tile footprint and behave like regular landscape elements: they can be demolished, or you can remove them just by building over them.

- **Oases:** Spawn in unique layouts based on probabilities taken from random bits of each tile.

![Oases.](_readme/oases.png)

- **Rocks:** Spawns yellow, gray, or brown rocks in deserts in one of 2^16 (65,536) layouts.

3. Place the file in your OpenTTD directory, (perhaps  `...\Users\USERNAME\Documents\OpenTTD\newgrf`).
4. Enable the NewGRF in the OpenTTD settings.
5. Configure [parameters](#parameters) as needed.
